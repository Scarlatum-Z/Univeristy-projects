Broadly speaking we have been tackling a range of problems of different areas of which you'll find only the most relevant, topics.
If at any point i have not been able to upload anything of interest to you. then please feel free to reach out to me, as this folder will be a work in progress over the next few years

Semester 1:
  SD1  -  SoftwareDesign1 was mainly focused, on getting comfortable with Python and its core concepts.
  Looking into the folder you'll only going to find our Project called Connect 4, its a python/pygame implementation of a childhood boardgame classic.
  I have chosen to only publish this project as it highlights everything that we did during our first semester.
  *As an important sidenote i have to thank my colleague at University, Christopher Metnizer for doing most of the heavy lifting; Only with his help and enormous patience the project has been finished.
